In this directory, you can:

1) Build the templates for the indices we have
2) Generate commands to create the templates
3) Generate the commands to update mappings

To build templates, run "make templates".  The makefile requires
a "header" file and several base files.

To generate either of the commands, you must have a URL where 
your ES instance is available.

If you are creating a new ES for CDM, you would first need to
build the templates, then run "create_indices.sh" to generate
the commands to create the indices,then run those commands.

If you need to update a mapping, you would first need to update the 
relevant base file, then re-generate the templates with make, then
run "update_mappings.sh" to generate the update mappings commands,
then run those commands.
